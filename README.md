## The game

### Objective

The Ocean Exploration and Research Society (OERS) have discovered an underwater coral labyrinth. Scans of the sea bed have revealed that there is an artefact of great power hidden within, and as expedition leader your job is to locate and retrieve it.

The artefact is located in the deepest part of the labyrinth, where the pressure is greatest. You should keep your oxygen levels from depleting by entering pockets of air.
